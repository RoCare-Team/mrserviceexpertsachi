                <p>At RO Care India, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our clients. RO Care India does not sell, rent, or loan any identifiable information at the individual level regarding its customers to any third party. Any information you provide us is held with the utmost care and security. This information is collected primarily to ensure that we can satisfy your needs and to deliver you a genuinely personalized shopping experience. When you buy products from RO Care India or register with us for any services, you have the choice of getting e-mails regarding updates about special offers, new products, and new services. We are also bound to cooperate fully if we are required by law or legal process to offer information about a client.

                    We might share non-personal, non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with our marketing partners, advertisers, or other third parties for advertising and research purposes. To put it differently, we won't tell our marketing partners that you purchased a particular solution, but we can tell them how many customers purchased that product. As a continuing policy of product improvement at RO Care India, the design and specifications are subject to change without prior notice. This Privacy Policy can be changed at the sole discretion of RO Care India from time to time. In the event of any concern about your privacy, please visit us at info@rocareindia.com and we will respond to you immediately.
